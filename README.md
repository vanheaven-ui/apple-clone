Additional description about the project and its features.
The project required use of gradient backgrounds and a variety of positioning and display properties. The cloned page was built using block, grid, flex, inline-block display properties with a mix of relative and absolute positioning property values. The cloned page is structured into four sections which include; 
- the navigation section (this was position to fall within the article section).
- the article section that wraps the big hero image that was positioned to flow into the top, left and right margins of the display screen.

- the footer section which has two sections separated by flex display property on their parent container.
